          Should I Adjust My Variance Value?

          Variance is the degree of randomness you selected. You may need to
          experiment with the variance value when you first construct your model
          until you find a value that works well.
          <br /><br />

          If your results are showing too many 'heavy favorites' (70% to win or
          stronger) with very few games that are close to 50-50, consider
          increasing your variance value and running your model again.
          <br /><br />

          If your results are showing too many 'toss-ups' (both teams close to
          50% to win) with very few games that have a strong favorite, consider
          decreasing your variance value and running your model again.

        <h5 class="card-title info-title dark-title">What is POW/POWER?</h5>
        <p class="card-text info-text dark-text">
          POWER is a rating of how good a team is for a particular day, based on
          the user-built model and the team's lineup, starting pitcher, and
          bullpen. POWER is independent of opponent, home-field advantage,
          batters on the team who are out of the day's lineup, and other
          starting pitchers on the team. A power score of 100 is equivalent to a
          perfectly average team.
          <br /><br />

          POWER essentially answers the question of 'how good is this team
          expected to be for today's game'? For example, on days where Jacob
          deGrom does not start, he does not affect New York's POWER.
          <br /><br />

          POWER is a measure of the strength of a team's lineup, starting
          pitcher, and bullpen, calculated using the user-selected general model
          criteria and the user-selected weights for each statistic. Because
          POWER is independent of home-field advantage, it is possible for an
          away team with higher POWER to be an underdog.

          What does DNQ (not enough IP) mean?
        </h5>
        <p class="card-text info-text dark-text">
          When a starting pitcher is listed as "DNQ (not enough IP) -
          replacement level stats used instead," this means that the pitcher has
          not qualified (at least ~10IP) in any of the last three seasons. The
          starting pitcher is assumed to be replacement level. A similar method
          is used for batters who have not qualified. For a complete
          mathematical description, you can read about
